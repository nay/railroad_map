RailroadMap
===========

This plugin generates documents of your application.
It's different from RDoc that the documents will be generated from real class information, not source codes.
Also this plugin aims to discribe the structure of your web application with MVC understanding.

But now, it can just simply list up the actions in your controllers.

To generate documents, rum the following rake task.

 > rake railroad_map

Then you can find the generated documents in doc/railroad_map.
